Playing

   keys respectively. To drop the coin in a particular column, press the down arrow key when the coin is on 
   top of that column.
4. A player gets a point when any four of the coins of his color are present consecutively in a line 
   (vertically, horizontally or diagonally).
5. The game ends when all the slots in the table are filled.
